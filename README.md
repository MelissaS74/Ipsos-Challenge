A personal profile/dashboard where a client can choose the best way to see the most important insights for them. The dashboard includes a personalised summary so they could receive automated, concise summaries of the findings that matter most to them, based on their interests and past interactions with the data. Secondly a chat bot window that would work via a chat GPT type platform whereby the client could find an answer to a specific question or area of the data. Following on from this, the dashboard would produce the top 3 recommended priorities or actions for the company to address based on the data. For a more user-centric angle, I envision an AI avatar animation or video to provide a more human-like interaction, explaining insights through conversation, story or a video presentation. As a final addition, using the combined efforts of data scientists, a useful USP to the dashboard offers simulation tools to forecast the potential outcomes of different actions, helping stakeholders to visualize the impact of their decisions before they make them.
